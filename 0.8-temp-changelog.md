# Changelog

**NOTE:** this will be manually filled as soon as 0.8 is developed.

## General

- Updated to latest libnx. This simplifies the code, and fixes potential issues? old libnx could have had.

- Some parts of the code were rewritten or simplified, in order to try to improve Goldleaf's performance.

- Removed forwarder. There are less ban-baity ways to launch homebrew as applications (via uLaunch or using Atmosphere's title override)

## Application

- Fixed a bug where deleting the currently selected user would leave Goldleaf in a buggy state (because it would still think that the user is valid)

- Now amiibo dumping is done via "debug" amiibo/NFP services. Since emuiibo intercepts user (and soon system) services, using debug services means Goldleaf will be able to dump real amiibos even if emuiibo is activated.

## Quark / USB

- Quark's target version was changed to Java 9 or higher, since trying to support Java 8 too made it complicated to get it working.

- USB system was changed, and it won't work with previous versions (latest Goldtree for instance, which supported up to 0.7.3)

- Now Goldleaf takes advantage of string descriptors on its USB communications:

  - Goldleaf's USB will have "Goldleaf" as the product string, so Quark can identify if the homebrew detected is actually Goldleaf. This particular change kills compatibility with any previous versions.

  - Goldleaf also sets it's version as the serial number descriptor, so Quark can use it. Development builds have "-dev" after the version ("0.8.0-dev", for instance), which will make Quark warn about its possible unstability.

## (Planned features)

- Integrated emuiibo 0.4.0 (next version) support

- Web browser bookmark system (skeleton code is already there)

- More internal code improvements

- Something else? (open to suggestions, will look into issues for ideas)

- Try to improve both filesystem and error system (the first one to use more the second one), since currently both are kinda poorly implemented

- Write proper documentation and FAQ, specially about Quark/USB
