## Current state (this will be removed when it gets released)

- Goldleaf is still NOT released. It can be built and tested, but it can complex and unstable.

- It is NOT recommended to try to build this project. It's easy to get messed up building it.

## What is Goldleaf?

- If you know what FBI is (related to 3DS homebrew), this is a similar project, for Nintendo Switch.

- Goldleaf is a multipurpose tool, specialized on title installing from NSP packages, but with other utilities, such as NAND/SD browsing, 

- You can easily manage title-related stuff, like install titles via NSP packages or uninstall already installed titles.

## What can Goldleaf do?

- Install NSP packages, browsing the SD card for the package (needs to be a `*.nsp` file).

- Force uninstall titles (this won't delete the save data of the titles).

- Browse currently installed tickets, and the option to delete them

- Browse NAND partitions, being able to copy files and paste them to the SD card (no delete/paste permissions on NAND)
